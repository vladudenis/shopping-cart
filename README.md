# Shopping Cart

## Description

This is my first genuine react project.

In this project managed to create an online shop where you can add items to your shopping cart and eventually check out to buy all the selected items.

I practiced react routing in this project, but also fine-tuned other important skills like dealing with hooks and using styled-components.
